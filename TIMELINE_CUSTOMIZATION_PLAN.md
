# Weekly Sprint Customization Plan

## Problem Analysis
The application currently has hardcoded "Weekly Sprint" content in multiple components:
- Settings.tsx: Description mentions "Show weekly sprint timeline and progress"
- DashboardOverview.tsx: Hardcoded "Weekly Sprint" title
- DashboardPreview.tsx: Hardcoded "Weekly Sprint" title

This prevents users from customizing the timeline section name to their preference.

## Solution Plan

### 1. Add Timeline Customization Setting
- Add new setting `timelineTitle` to DashboardSettings interface
- Update default settings to include customizable timeline title
- Allow users to rename "Weekly Sprint" to their preferred term

### 2. Update Settings Interface
- Add timeline title input field to settings panel
- Provide sensible default options (Weekly Sprint, Study Plan, Focus Week, etc.)
- Include preview of how the title will appear

### 3. Update Components
- DashboardOverview.tsx: Use customizable timeline title
- DashboardPreview.tsx: Use customizable timeline title
- Settings.tsx: Add UI for customizing timeline title

### 4. Enhanced User Experience
- Provide preset options for common timeline names
- Allow completely custom input
- Real-time preview in settings

## Files to Edit
1. `types/dashboard.ts` - Add timelineTitle setting
2. `components/Settings.tsx` - Add timeline title customization UI
3. `components/DashboardOverview.tsx` - Use customizable timeline title
4. `components/DashboardPreview.tsx` - Use customizable timeline title

## Expected Benefits
- Users can personalize their timeline section name
- Better alignment with individual study preferences
- More flexible and user-friendly interface
- Consistent customization across all timeline displays

## Implementation Steps
1. Add timelineTitle to DashboardSettings interface
2. Update default settings with timelineTitle
3. Add UI controls in Settings component
4. Update timeline display components to use setting
5. Test functionality across all components
